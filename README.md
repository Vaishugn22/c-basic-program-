1. Simulation of a Simple Calculator.  
2. Compute the roots of a quadratic equation by accepting the coefficients. Print appropriate messages.   
3. An electricity board charges the following rates for the use of electricity: for the first 200 units 80 paise per unit: for the next 100 units 90 paise per unit: beyond 300 units Rs 1 per unit. All users are charged a minimum of Rs. 100 as meter charge. If the total amount is more than Rs 400, then an additional surcharge of 15% of the total amount is charged. Write a program to read the name of the user, the number of units consumed, and print out the charges.  
4. Implement Binary Search on Integers / Names. 
5. Implement Matrix multiplication and validate the rules of multiplication.  
6. Compute sin(x)/cos(x) using Taylor series approximation. Compare your result with the built-in library function. Print both the results with appropriate inferences.
7. Sort the given set of N numbers using Bubble sort. 
8. Write functions to implement string operations such as compare, concatenate, string length. Convince the parameter passing techniques.
9. Implement structures to read, write and compute average- marks and the students scoring above and below the average marks for a class of N students.
10. Develop a program using pointers to compute the sum, mean and standard deviation of all elements stored in an array of  N  real numbers.
11. Implement Recursive functions for Binary to Decimal Conversion.
