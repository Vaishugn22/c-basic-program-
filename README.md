- Simulation of a Simple Calculator.  
- Compute the roots of a quadratic equation by accepting the coefficients. Print appropriate messages.   
- An electricity board charges the following rates for the use of electricity: for the first 200 units 80 paise per unit: for the next 100 units 90 paise per unit: beyond 300 units Rs 1 per unit. All users are charged a minimum of Rs. 100 as meter charge. If the total amount is more than Rs 400, then an additional surcharge of 15% of the total amount is charged. Write a program to read the name of the user, the number of units consumed, and print out the charges.  
- Implement Binary Search on Integers / Names. 
- Implement Matrix multiplication and validate the rules of multiplication.  
- Compute sin(x)/cos(x) using Taylor series approximation. Compare your result with the built-in library function. Print both the results with appropriate inferences.
- Sort the given set of N numbers using Bubble sort. 
- Write functions to implement string operations such as compare, concatenate, string length. Convince the parameter passing techniques.
- Implement structures to read, write and compute average- marks and the students scoring above and below the average marks for a class of N students.
- Develop a program using pointers to compute the sum, mean and standard deviation of all elements stored in an array of  N  real numbers.
- Implement Recursive functions for Binary to Decimal Conversion.
